What you need
=============
* equinox
* ghc

Directories and files
=====================
* ok/ contains examples for which equinox gives the right expected answer.
* diverges/ contains examples for which equinox diverges (or converges too slowly, who knows?)
* Script f.hs c takes the source file f.hs and the name c of the function whose contract is to check and generates the file f.hs.tptp
* test f.hs c runs Script and then equinox
* fulltest d takes a directory and apply test to every hs files in the directory.

Binaries
========
The binaries are built on a 64 bits Ubuntu (11.4)
* equinox: ...
* Script: lies in the haskellcontracts repository in the contracts directory. A ghc --make Script.hs should do the trick.
