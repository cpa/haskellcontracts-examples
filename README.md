What you need
=============
* equinox
* ghc

Directories and files
=====================
* ok/ contains examples for which equinox gives the right expected answer. Warning: sometimes it is expected for equinox to hang because the function doesn't satisfy its contract! (see extrasimple.hs)
* diverges/ contains examples for which equinox diverges (or converges too slowly, who knows?)

Usage
=====

See the README of the haskellcontracts repo.
